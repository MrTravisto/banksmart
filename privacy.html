<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: January 2026</strong></p>

<p>BankSmart (banksmart.co.za) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting 
any personal information you may share with us.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>BankSmart does not collect, store, or process personal information.  
We do not require login, do not store salary inputs, and do not track individuals.</p>

<p>If Google Analytics (GA4) is added in the future, it may collect anonymous 
usage data such as page views and general device information. This does not 
identify you personally.</p>

<h2>2. Cookies</h2>
<p>BankSmart does not use cookies unless Google Analytics is added in the future, 
in which case only anonymous analytics cookies may be used.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>Our website includes links to external banks and financial institutions.  
We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those websites.</p>

<h2>4. Data Protection (POPIA & GDPR)</h2>
<p>Because BankSmart does not process identifiable personal information, we do 
not maintain user profiles or customer databases. All user inputs remain on 
your device and are never transmitted to our servers.</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted 
on this page with the “Last updated” date changed accordingly.</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
